# rtmidi-jna: JNA-based RtMidi JVM binding

This project is set up to build a consumable Jar library that bundles built-in [rtmidi](https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi) binaries from the fairly up to date (i.e. not outdated) sources, and then bundle them within a Jar using jnaerator-gradle-plugin (of [my fork](https://github.com/atsushieno/gradle-jnaerator-plugin)).

I set this up primarily for [ktmidi](https://github.com/atsushieno/ktmidi) project.
